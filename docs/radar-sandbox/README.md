# Radar Sandbox

A weather sandbox, not a forecast. Paint rain, drop thunderstorms, place
lows, highs and fronts on real terrain, then step time and watch radar,
satellite and surface maps evolve with sensible 5–60 minute steps.

Open `index.html` through any static server (GitHub Pages serves it from
`docs/radar-sandbox/`). There is no build step. ES modules only. Terrain
tiles load from AWS Terrain Tiles at runtime.

## Regions

Europe, SE Europe, Adriatic, Montenegro and **Radar Uljenje**. The
Uljenje view copies the DHMZ product: 248 km range ring, E-W and N-S
max-reflectivity side views, and the DHMZ colour scale. Scroll the mouse
wheel to zoom anywhere; that makes a *Custom* region. The weather carries
over between regions.

## Map modes

Radar (composite reflectivity), rain rate, accumulation, 2 m temperature,
dew point, humidity, wind and gusts (with flow particles), pressure
(isobars, L/H), satellite (visible by day, IR or enhanced IR), CAPE and
echo tops.

## Tools

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| Drag | Move storms and L/H centres. Drag empty space to push rain, clouds and air masses. |
| Rain | Paints lift and moisture. The rain area drifts with the steering wind and fades once its forcing decays (~3 h). |
| Storm | Single cell, multicell or supercell (right-mover with hook echo). |
| Squall | A line of storms that propagates forward and rebuilds itself. |
| Low / High | Press at the centre, drag outward for size. Strength sets the depth. |
| Cold / warm front | Temperature step plus a lift band. A cold front fires a squall line when there is CAPE. |
| Moisture / Heat | Paint humid or dry, warm or cold air. |
| Erase | Wipes everything under the brush. |
| Radar site | Puts a radar anywhere, with its ring, beam overshoot, terrain blocking, clutter and C-band attenuation. |

Atmosphere controls: the steering wind (drag the compass arrow), 0–6 km
shear, T850, T500, humidity, sea temperature, sun heating, storm trigger and
sea breeze. Six scenarios start you off: Adriatic autumn showers, summer
heat storms, a Genoa low with jugo, bura, a supercell day and a blank
canvas.

**Auto weather** (on by default) keeps things moving while you play. The
steering wind veers and backs toward drifting regimes, and the air mass
(temperatures, humidity, shear) wanders around the scenario's values.
Every 1.5–4 simulated hours something new drifts in from upwind: a trough,
a ridge, a rain band, a cold or warm front, colder air aloft, a moist surge
or a wind shift. A small banner names it. This also happens on the blank
canvas. **Flow variety** scales the free atmosphere described below.

Keys: `Space` play/pause, `→` step, `←` back. The timeline keeps the last
72 frames. Editing an earlier frame rewrites the future.

## How the weather works (`js/sim.js`)

The engine runs on a ~200-cell grid over the visible map.

- **Pressure and wind.** A background gradient comes from the steering wind,
  plus Gaussian lows and highs with a gradient-wind correction. Surface
  wind is turned toward low pressure by friction (more over land), blocked
  by slopes, accelerated downslope (bura) and modulated by a diurnal sea
  breeze.
- **Free atmosphere.** Even with no lows or highs placed, a slowly evolving
  pattern of troughs, ridges and eddies (a noise stream function, ~500 km
  scale) bends the wind in different directions across the map. It adds
  matching pressure dips and bumps and ascent in the troughs. Mesoscale
  lift noise (~75 km) breaks rain areas into bands and holes.
- **Temperature and moisture.** Both are advected semi-Lagrangian and
  relaxed toward an equilibrium. That equilibrium comes from the air mass
  (T850), the lapse rate over the terrain, sea temperature and the sun:
  solar zenith angle for the real date and place, damped by cloud.
- **Stratiform rain.** Lift from convergence, upslope flow, warm advection
  and lows condenses moisture into a cloud-water reservoir. It rains out
  over ~15 min and drifts with the steering wind. It needs a deep moist
  layer (surface RH plus a mid-level humidity field), so dry summer days
  stay convective.
- **Convection.** CAPE comes from parcel theory: the theta-e of a lightly
  mixed surface parcel against the 500 hPa temperature. Storms are
  Lagrangian cells with growth, mature and decay stages. They start where
  CAPE meets a trigger: lift, daytime heating of high ground, gust fronts,
  or cold air over a warm sea. Each storm rains, builds a cold pool and a
  gust front, and spawns daughters on its right-forward flank (or upwind
  when backbuilding against terrain). Supercells move right of the mean
  wind. Lightning rate rises with reflectivity and echo top.
- **Radar** (`js/radar.js`) renders at ~1 km. Stratiform texture rides on
  two flow-following coordinate layers, so it moves and deforms with the
  local wind. The layers are advected and reset alternately every 3 h. The
  texture adds bands, holes and embedded heavier cores. Storm cells have irregular shapes, internal cores and hooks.
  In single-site mode the beam follows 4/3-earth geometry with a terrain
  horizon per azimuth, a range-dependent detection threshold and C-band
  path-integrated attenuation.
